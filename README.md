- **Final Project for "Using Python for Research" by Harvard** [(https://github.com/paula-martinezmoreno/Final-Project-for-Using-Python-for-Research-by-Harvard.git)]: This project predicts physical activity types using tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data, applying data analysis, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques.
  
- **Data analysis Health and lifestyle dataset** [https://github.com/paula-martinezmoreno/Data-analysis---Health-and-lifestyle-dataset.git]:A portfolio showcasing R data analysis projects, including data preparation, exploratory analysis, contingency table analysis, principal component analysis, correspondence analysis, and hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analysis.
  
- **New York Taxi Trips Analysis** [https://github.com/paula-martinezmoreno/New-York-Taxi-Trips-Analysis.git]: This repository contains code analyzing New York City taxi trips dataset using Apache Spark. The dataset covers over 1 billion individual taxi trips in the city from January 2009 through January 2023. The analysis focuses on exploring various aspects of taxi traffic, including seasonalities, geographical patterns, and the impact of external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
