# Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of the code and projects I have worked on during my studies in mathematics and statistics, with a focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.

## Contents

- **Bachelor's Thesis: Route Selection with Probabilistic Optimization through Geospatial Deep Learning** [(https://github.com/paula-martinezmoreno/)]: This project addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) by combining predictive demand modeling with a T-GCN (Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks) algorithm, as well as two algorithms to optimize route planning efficiency and reduce costs: Genetic Algorithm and Algorithm using Googles OT-Tools. It also contains the processing and analysis of data for routes and demands, using New York City data set. 
  
- **Final Project for "Using Python for Research" by Harvard** [(https://github.com/paula-martinezmoreno/Final-Project-for-Using-Python-for-Research-by-Harvard.git)]: This project predicts physical activity types using tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data, applying data analysis, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques.
  
- **Data analysis Health and lifestyle dataset** [(https://github.com/paula-martinezmoreno/Data-analysis---Health-and-lifestyle-dataset.git)]: A portfolio showcasing R data analysis projects, including data preparation, exploratory analysis, contingency table analysis, principal component analysis, correspondence analysis, and hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analysis.
  
- **New York Taxi Trips Analysis** [(https://github.com/paula-martinezmoreno/New-York-Taxi-Trips-Analysis.git)]: This repository contains code analyzing New York City taxi trips dataset using Apache Spark. The dataset covers over 1 billion individual taxi trips in the city from January 2009 through January 2023. The analysis focuses on exploring various aspects of taxi traffic, including seasonalities, geographical patterns, and the impact of external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
